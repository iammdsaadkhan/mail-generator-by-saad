ðŸš€ CS50 Final Project: Mail ID & Password Generator (v1.0.2)
For my CS50 final project, I developed a sleek HTML-based Mail ID & Password Generator that instantly creates a unique email ID and secure password based on user input. Version 1.0.1 focused on clean UI, efficient front-end design, and practical functionality.
ðŸ”§ Latest Update (v1.0.2)
The tool now includes JavaScript-powered copy-to-clipboard buttons for both email and password, enhancing usability. More importantly, itâ€™s been upgraded to meet the exact formatting standards required for my role as a Personal Data Entry Operator Job. The generator now dynamically produces compliant employee IDs and secure passwords tailored to organizational guidelinesâ€”bridging academic innovation with real-world utility.
